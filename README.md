#NSU Emu by SMX:
PREPARATION:
------------------
You need to download and install XAMPP. You can get it from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html <br>
After you're done installing XAMPP, download and install Dual DHCP DNS Server http://sourceforge.net/projects/dhcp-dns-server/ <br>
*NOTE: DualServer should work on *Unix like OSes too, but you can aswell use an alternative SW like dnsmasq <br>

CONFIGURATION:
-------------------
Open C:\Xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf (or the equivalent on your OS) and add the following

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)\.laf$ $1.php [L]
```

This will redirect all requests to files with .laf extension to .php ones <br>
So for example: CheckSWManualUpdate.laf --> CheckSWManualUpdate.php <br>
<br>
Then search for "DocumentRoot" and change
```
/xampp/htdocs
```
with
```
/xampp/htdocs/nsu_emu
```

Open the XAMPP control panel and start/restart apache

-------------------

Go to your network adapter configuration and make sure the IP is set to static. Open the DNS configuration <br>
(on Windows it's under Adapter Settings, IPV4, Advanced, DNS) and make sure you have

* \<your LAN IP\>
* 8.8.8.8
* 8.8.4.4
* \<your Router IP\>

in the list, in that order. The lan ip will be used for custom hostnames, and the others will be used as Forwarding Servers <br>
for all other requests.

Open C:\DualServer\DualServer.ini (or the equivalent on your OS) and perform the following steps: <br>
under [DNS_HOSTS] section add:
```
snu.lge.com.usgcac.cdnetworks.net=\<your LAN IP\>
su.lge.com=<your LAN IP>
```

under [ï»¿WILD_HOSTS] section add:
```
su.lge.*=<your LAN IP>
snu.lge.*=<your LAN IP>
```

under [ALIASES] section add:
```
snu.lge.com.usgcac.cdnetworks.net=snu.lge.com
```

then under [RANGE_SET] section make sure that: <br>
* "DHCPRange" is a valid range in your subnet
* "SubmetMask" is not commented (comments are ';' or '#' symbols) and correct (usually 255.255.255.0 is ok)
* "DomainServer" is not commented and points to your LAN IP, e.g
```
DomainServer=<your LAN IP>
```
* "Router" is not commented and points to your LAN router, e.g
```
Router=192.168.0.1
```

Save the config and run "RunStandAlone.bat"<br>
<br>
Now you can check by opening a browser and going to "http://snu.lge.com" and "http://su.lge.com"<br>
It should point to the Apache directory listing with our files in<br>
<br>
Now Create the new directory "nsu_emu" in "xampp/htdocs" and copy the files there<br>
<br>
If you're running on linux, run setup_dirs.sh to create the needed directories with the proper permissions<br>

NSU CONFIGURATION:
-------------------
edit server.cfg (check the file comments for details)<br>
create a folder named "epks" and store your epk files there<br>
eventually create a folder named "models" if you have custom hand-crafted response files in xml format you want to use (don't supply base64 encoded responses)<br>

If you want to make sure the configuration works, navigate to "http://127.0.0.1/upload.php" and you'll find a test page.<br>
You can use that page to **simulate** an LG TV that is requesting a FW update.<br>
Use the File chooser to select a REQUEST file (REQUEST, not RESPONSE). You can get Requests by using WireShark or checking the "requests" directory.<br>
The Emulator will dump all the requests there, so you can just check for FW update (even without server.cfg configured) and it will dump request<br>
